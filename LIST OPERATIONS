HERE IS THE PROGRAME FOR LIST OPERATIONS.

SOURCE CODE:
      # Creating a list
      lst = []  
      print("Initial list:", lst)

      # Appending elements to the list
      lst.append(10)
      lst.append(20)
      lst.append(30)
      print("List after appending elements:", lst)

      # Appending a list of elements
      lst.extend([40, 50, 60])
      print("List after extending with multiple elements:", lst)

      # Removing an element from the list by value
      lst.remove(20)
      print("List after removing an element (20):", lst)

EXPLANATION:
      1.AT FIRST I CREATED A EMPTY LIST CALLED "lst".
      2.AND THEN I APPENDED THE ELEMENTS USING ("append()") FUNCTION.
      3.AND THEN I APPENDED THE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS BY PASSING A LIST IN AN extend() FUNCTION.
      4.AND I REMOVED AN ELEMENT "20" FROM A LIST USING remove() FUNCTION.
