THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF A GREATEST OF THREE NUMBERS.

SOURCE CODE:
     # Taking three inputs from the user
     a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
     b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
     c = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

     # Using a conditional expression to find the largest number
     max_val = a if (a >= b and a >= c) else (b if b >= c else c)

     # Printing the result
     print("The largest number is:", max_val)

EXPLANATION:
   1.The largest number is determined using a conditional expression (ternary operator).
   2.If a is greater than or equal to both b and c, it is assigned to max_val.
   3.Otherwise, it checks if b is greater than or equal to c, and assigns either b or c as the largest.
   4.AND FINALLY THE LARGEST NUMBER IN GIVEN INPUTS WILL BE PRINTED.
ALTERNATIVE:
   1.WE CAN GO WITH THE BUILT IN FUNCTION max() TO RETRIVE THE LARGEST INTEGER.
   2.WE CAN SORT THE GIVEN NUMBERS IN A LIST AND TAKE THE LARGEST VALUE  (WHICH WILL BE THE LAST INDEX AFTER SORTING).
